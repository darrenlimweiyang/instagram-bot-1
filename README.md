# instagram-bot-1

TG: @deranzxc

Welcome to my first repository. This repo is focused on the creation of an
Instagram bot, making use of Selenium & Python.

Inspired by: https://medium.com/@mottet.dev/lets-create-an-instagram-bot-to-show-you-the-power-of-selenium-349d7a6744f7

This project started when I was interested in scrapping Instagram information for analysis. I realised I needed a way to auto-login into Instagram and hence started the creation of this bot.

## Feature List

- [X] Auto - Login
- [X] Following someone given a set of usernames

- [X] Liking every single photo of one's profile
- [ ] Getting every caption from a profile
